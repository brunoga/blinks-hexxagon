# blinks-hexxagon
Hexxagon Game for Blinks by Move38.

This project uses Git Submodules. To clone it, use:

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/brunoga/blinks-hexxagon hexxagon

Note that if you are using the Arduino IDE, you must clone it to a directory called "hexxagon" (the command above does that). This is because Arduino IDE requires both the sketch and the directory to have the same name.
