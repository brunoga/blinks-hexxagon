# Introduction

In a distant future in a different planet where overpopulation is the biggest problem an entire civilization is facing, land became the most valuable resource (specially fertile land) and having access to it is a matter of life or death.

Nations defend their land with all they've got, but the need for expansion is pressing all of them and a major worldwide war was about to become inevitable when a major earthquake hit in the middle of a major ocean and this caused underwater volcanoes to  erupt and form a huge new mass of land.

This was just too tempting and certainly beat the prospect of having to fight other nations at your border. Armies were sent to take hold of the new land and the inevitable worldwide war was now, at least for the moment, happening on a remote land in the middle of nowhere.

You are tasked with being the main strategist for your nation in this effort. As such, you will be controlling the most advanced battle equipment ever devised, capable of not only fighting enemy armies but also being able to terraform and defend any conquered land and replicate itself to continue expansion.

Even with this advanced equipment, your task will not be easy. At every turn you will have to make difficult decisions.

Godspeed.

# How to Play

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Number of Players</b></td><td>2 to 4</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Number of Blinks</b></td><td>12 to 128</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Play Time</b></td><td>5 to 30 minutes</td>
  </tr>
</table>

As the strategist, your main objective is to decide how and where to move your expansion efforts so you can increase your controlled area and, whenever possible, take over controlled area from other players. You also need to be carefull as the other players will be trying to do just the same.

Your main interface to do that is a highly advanced (if simple-looking) piece of gear: The Battle Linked Interface Network Kit (a.k.a. BLINK). Each BLINK is a small hexagonal piece that represents one unit of area that can be controlled by a player. You will have access to several of these devices that are linked together in a way that represents the disputed area and you will be able to use this representation to direct your troops movement.

## Setting Up

You should have received several BLINKs that might need to be setup before you can start controlling your troops. Please locate the BLINK that is explicitly marked with Hexxagon as that will be the one with the latest version of the strategic software. Set it aside.

Connect all other BLINKs in the shape of the disputed area (keep in mind that the Hexxagon BLINK will be connected later on). Make sure all your BLINKs are powered on (if they are, they should show lights. If not, just click them). Press your Hexxagon BLINK button and hold until you see a fast-flashing blue light animation. Release the button (it will switch to a slower rotating animation) and connect it to your disputed area representation and notice the software being spread to the other BLINKs. Wait until all BLINKs show an YELLOW-ish pulse animation. Please see this instructional video for more information: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQyzGJMQOqY
