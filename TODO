Detect face disconnections and take appropriate action. If a Blink is removed
during mapping, game muts be reset. If it is removed during gameplay, give
players a chance to reconnect (they can reset manually if needed in
pathological cases).

Game reset should unblock all sends. Currently this does not happen and the game
can potentially get stuck.

Better AI Blink connection handling. Currently it sometimes thinks it was
disconnected. Use the new connection tracking feature for that too?

General tweaks here and there.
